# CleanAirSights Backend Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed:

### 1. Environment Variables Not Loading
**Problem**: Docker Compose was not reading environment variables from `.env.prod` properly on Windows.

**Solution**: Created `start-production.ps1` script that explicitly loads environment variables and sets them in the PowerShell session before running Docker Compose.

### 2. Missing System Dependencies in Docker Container
**Problem**: Backend Dockerfile.prod was missing essential system dependencies like `libhdf5-dev`, `libnetcdf-dev`, and `curl`.

**Solution**: Updated `backend/Dockerfile.prod` to include necessary system packages:
```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    gcc \
    g++ \
    libhdf5-dev \
    libnetcdf-dev \
    curl \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

### 3. Poor Error Handling in Application Startup
**Problem**: FastAPI application was crashing during startup if database connection or scheduler initialization failed.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive error handling in `main.py` lifespan function:
- Database connection failures are caught and logged, but don't stop the app
- Scheduler initialization failures are caught and logged, but don't stop the app
- Proper cleanup in shutdown with null checks

### 4. Port Conflicts with Local Services
**Problem**: MongoDB and Redis containers were trying to bind to ports already in use by local instances.

**Solution**: Modified `docker-compose.prod.yml` to only expose ports internally within the Docker network instead of binding to host ports:
```yaml
expose:
  - "27017"  # Instead of ports: - "127.0.0.1:27017:27017"
```

### 5. Incorrect MongoDB Configuration
**Problem**: MongoDB configuration file was created as a directory instead of a file, causing container restart loops.

**Solution**: 
- Removed incorrect directory structure
- Created proper `mongodb/mongod.conf` file with production settings
- Temporarily removed config file reference to use default settings

### 6. Missing SSL Certificates
**Problem**: Nginx was failing to start because SSL certificates were not properly mounted in the container.

**Solution**: 
- Created temporary HTTP-only nginx configuration (`nginx-http-only.conf`)
- Modified docker-compose to use HTTP-only config until SSL can be properly restored

### 7. CORS Configuration Issues
**Problem**: CORS origins were hardcoded for development, not production domain.

**Solution**: Updated `config.py` to use different CORS origins based on environment:
```python
@property
def cors_origins_list(self) -> List[str]:
    # Use allowed_origins for production, cors_origins for development
    origins = self.allowed_origins if self.environment == "production" else self.cors_origins
    return [origin.strip() for origin in origins.split(",")]
```

## Current Status:
✅ All containers are running successfully
✅ Backend API is responding correctly
✅ Database connections are working
✅ API endpoints return proper JSON responses
✅ Demo data is being served while real data collection is being set up

## Next Steps:
1. Restore SSL certificates for HTTPS functionality
2. Configure Let's Encrypt certificate renewal
3. Update nginx to use HTTPS configuration
4. Test all API endpoints thoroughly
5. Monitor logs for any remaining issues

## Commands to Test:
```bash
# Test API directly
curl -H "Host: cleanairsight.earth" http://localhost/api/current

# Check container status
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps

# View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f backend
```
