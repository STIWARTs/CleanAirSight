## üí° Demo Talking Points

### For Judges:

**Opening (30 seconds):**
> "CleanAirSight combines satellite remote sensing with ground-based measurements and machine learning to provide comprehensive air quality monitoring. As you can see from our dashboard, we integrate NASA's TEMPO satellite - launched in 2023 - with thousands of ground sensors across North America."

**Point to Header:**
> "The NASA TEMPO instrument provides hourly observations of pollutants like NO‚ÇÇ, O‚ÇÉ, and HCHO at unprecedented 2.1km spatial resolution."

**Hover over cards:**
> "Each card shows real-time AQI with tomorrow's forecast. Hovering reveals the pollutant breakdown - notice we're integrating multiple data sources to give a complete picture."

**Point to status panel:**
> "Our system runs autonomously with scheduled data collection every 15-60 minutes, respecting API rate limits while maintaining freshness. You can see all four XGBoost models are trained and ready for predictions."

**Point to data sources:**
> "We harmonize data from NASA TEMPO satellite, OpenAQ and EPA AirNow ground sensors, plus weather context from OpenWeatherMap. This multi-source approach improves accuracy and confidence in our predictions."
